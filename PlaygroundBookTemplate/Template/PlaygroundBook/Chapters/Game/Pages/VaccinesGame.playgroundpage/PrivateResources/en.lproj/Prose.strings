## Experience the Power of [Vaccines](glossary://vaccine) in the Hands of the Immune System.

## So what do each of the elements represent?

The [red cells](glossary://redBloodCell) represent common [red blood cells](glossary://redBloodCell) which make up a majority of the bloodstream.

The blue Y-shaped structure is an [antibody](glossary://antibody) which neutralizes the viruses' [antigens](glossary://antigen).

The green cell from which [antibodies](glossary://antibody) shoot out from is a [B Cell](glossary://bCell).

![B Cell](/UserModules/bCell-removebg-preview)

The green cell covered in blue structures represents an infected [B Cell](glossary://bCell), indicating the game is over and your defensive measures have been neutralized by the [viruses](glossary://virus).

![Infected B Cell](/UserModules/infectedBCell-removebg-preview)

A blue cell demonstrates a infection of a common [red blood cell](glossary://redBloodCell). This occurence is what you want to prevent.

## Letâ€™s play


Directions:
1. Tap once to start off the motion of elements in the scene
2. Tap to shoot [antibody](glossary://antibody) and destroy the [viruses](glossary://virus).
3. Keep [viruses](glossary://virus) away from the [B Cell](glossary://bCell) (the shooter cell). If the [B Cell](glossary://bCell) is infected, your body's defences are destroyed and the [viruses](glossary://virus) infect the rest of the blood stream.

ðŸŽ¯ Do you remember your mission? You must keep your [B Cell](glossary://bCell) alive and hold control of the bloodstream's [red blood cells](glossary://redBloodCells) until macrophages arrive to clean up.

- Experiment: Try making the game harder by increasing the number of [viruses](glossary://virus). Or, if you need, feel free to reduce the number of [viruses](glossary://virus).";
