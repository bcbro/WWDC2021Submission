## So what is this game?

Well, it's a game that demonstrates the power of [vaccines](glossary://vaccine) in the body's fight against [viruses](glossary://virus). Now this section is going to show you the power of [vaccines](glossary://vaccine) in the immune system as well as the immense impact the presence of [vaccines](glossary://vaccine) can have on the body's response to [viruses](glossary://virus).

## Mechanisms of the [Viruses](glossary://virus) in an Organism's Immune System

Let's first start off with the mechanisms of the [viruses](glossary://virus) and how it works against the immune system.

A [virus](glossary://virus) is defined as an infectious agent that utilzes living organisms to reproduce. When a [virus](glossary://virus) enters a living organism, it seeks out a cell and attempts to bind its [antigen](glossary://antigen), a shape protein structure, to one of the cell's [receptors](glossary://receptor). After binding to one of the cell's [receptors](glossary://receptor), it injects its own [DNA](glossary://dna) in order to form a series of proteins that come together to form a [virus](glossary://virus). This cycle of reproduction continues until the [viruses](glossary://virus) met the prowess of the vaccinated immune system.

## Influence of a [Vaccine](glossary://vaccine) on the Immune System

[Vaccines](glossary://vaccine) are a form of biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. After a [vaccine](glossary://vaccine) is injected into an organism, the vaccine is studied by a [T Cell](glossary://tCell). The [T Cell](glossary://tCell) will then conclude this [vaccine](glossary://vaccine) is a pathogen and prepare the [B Cells](glossary://bCell) to exploit a perceptible weakness of the pathogen. The [B Cell](glossary://bCell) will then deploy proteins made by the cell that block [antigens](glossary://antigen) of the [virus](glossary://virus) from binding to the cell called [antibodies](glossary://antibody). If the exploited weakness seems to work, the [T Cell](glossary://tCell) will store the weakness of the virus within itself. The newly found information on the [virus](glossary://virus)' weakness will be distributed to [T Cells](glossary://tCell) across the organism's entire bloodstream.

![Interesting Fact: The HIV virus actually targets [B Cells](glossary://bCell) to stop the [antibody](glossary://antibody) production.]()

## If the [Virus](glossary://virus) Enters the Bloodstream After the [Vaccine](glossary://vaccine)...

Now, when the [virus](glossary://virus) enters the bloodstream, the [T Cells](glossary://tCell) will recognize the [antigens](glossary://antigen) on the [virus](glossary://virus) from their previous encounters with the [vaccine](glossary://vaccine)'s pathogens. The [T Cells](glossary://tCell) will accordingly activate the [B Cell](glossary://bCell) and start up the organism's response to the [virus](glossary://virus). The [virus](glossary://virus) will then be neutralized by the variety of [antibodies](glossary://antibody) sent by the [B Cell](glossary://bCell). In addition to the [B Cell](glossary://bCell)'s antibodies, macrophages are utilized in the cleanup of infected cells in which the cells are injected with acids that break it down and then the macrophages intake the infected cell.";
