## The Idea Behind This Project.

Recently, the emergence of [vaccines](glossary://vaccine) has brought some hope and relief to people all around in the world as they collectively fight Covid-19. As countries rush to organize [vaccine](glossary://vaccine) deployment to their citizens, they have come face-to-face with an unexpected magnitude of resistance. Countries all across the world have a surplus of [vaccines](glossary://vaccine) which have found no interest among their citizens. As these powerful mechanisms of science lay untouched, millions of people continue to get infected due to the misinformation unnecessarily spread. This lack of knowledge on [vaccines](glossary://vaccine) and their assistance to the immune system indirectly spurs this distrust in [vaccines](glossary://vaccine). Thus, this simulation/game project seeks to provide information and knowledge on viruses.

## So what is this simulation?

This simulation will demonstrate the immune system's lack of response when the immune system has not been provided a [vaccine](glossary://vaccine) corresponding to the viruses' [antigens](glossary://antigen). Then you can experience the power of [vaccines](glossary://vaccine) in the hands of the immune system.

## Mechanisms of the [Viruses](glossary://virus) in an Organism's Immune System

Let's first start off with the mechanisms of the [viruses](glossary://virus) and how it works against the immune system.

A [virus](glossary://virus) is defined as an infectious agent that utilizes living organisms to reproduce. When a [virus](glossary://virus) enters a living organism, it seeks out a cell and attempts to bind its [antigen](glossary://antigen), a shape protein structure, to one of the cell's [receptors](glossary://receptor). After binding to one of the cell's [receptors](glossary://receptor), it injects its own [DNA](glossary://dna) in order to form a series of proteins that come together to form a [virus](glossary://virus). This cycle of reproduction continues until the [viruses](glossary://virus) met the prowess of the vaccinated immune system.";
